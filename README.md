[English][[中文说明]](./README_zh.md)

ScratchPaper is a Gradle Plugin helps distinguish the buildType/flavor/version via APK icon overlay, bases on [Polyfill](https://github.com/2BAB/Polyfill).

## How does it work?

![](./images/launchers_json.jpg)

> If you install both debug&release Apps in one device, you can not distinguish which is the one you want to test.

ScratchPaper can add a overlay on your icon, and put given information (like buildType, buildVersion) on it.

- Support regular & round Icons 
- Support adaptive-icon
- Support AAPT2
- Support custom text

> If you have more than one staging Apps for QA or other colleagues, when they found some issues you may don't know how to match the App version to your code base (branch/commit/etc..), because all of them share the same version like "2.1.0-SNAPSHOT".

ScratchPaper supports generating build information into your artifact (which can read from /assets/scratch-paper.json) and also `/intermedias/scratch-paper/assets` directory including:

- Base: Build Time, Build Type, etc.
- Git: Latest Commit ID & commit branch, etc.
- Dependencies
- ...

## Why choose ScratchPaper?

We can find some similar solutions from Github，such as：akonior/icon-version, akaita/easylauncher-gradle-plugin. But the pain points of them are:

- Some do not support AAPT2
- Some do not support latest AGP

You should try ScratchPaper if you keep using latest build tools.

## Usage

**0x01. Add the plugin to classpath:**

``` gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        ...
        mavenCentral() // Since 2.5.4, the publish repository has been shifted from Jcenter to Maven Central.
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.0'
        classpath 'me.2bab:scratchpaper:2.6.0' // Since 2.5.4, the artifactId of ScratchPaper changed from scratch-paper to scratchpaper
    }
}
```

**0x02. Apply Plugin:**

``` gradle
// On Application's build.gradle (do not use in Library project)
apply plugin: 'me.2bab.scratchpaper'
```

**0x03. Advanced Configurations**

``` gradle
scratchPaper {
    textSize = 10
    textColor = "#FFFFFFFF"
    verticalLinePadding = 4
    backgroundColor = "#99000000"
    extraInfo = new Date().format("MM-dd,HH:mm")
    enableGenerateIconOverlay = true
    enableGenerateBuildInfo = true
    enableVersionNameSuffixDisplay = true
    
    // Experimental field
    // @see IconOverlayGenerator#removeXmlIconFiles
    enableXmlIconRemove = false
}
```

**0x04. Build your App and Enjoy!**

Check this [link](https://medium.com/walmartlabs/check-out-these-5-git-tips-before-your-next-commit-c1c7a5ae34d1) to make sure everyone will make a **meaningful** commit message.

So far we haven't added any hook tool, but follow the regex below:

```
(chore|feat|docs|fix|refactor|style|test|hack|release)(:)( )(.{0,80})
```


## v1.x (Deprecated)

The v1.x `IconCover` forked from [icon-version@akonior](https://github.com/akonior/icon-version). It provided icon editor functions that compatible with `Aapt1`, and I added some little enhancement like hex color support, custom text support. As time goes by, we have to move to `Aapt2` sooner or later. So I decide to revamp the whole project and add more fancy features. **If you are still using `Aapt1` with `IconCover`, now is the time to consider moving into the new one.**
